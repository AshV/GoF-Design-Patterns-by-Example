# State Design Pattern by Example

![State Design Pattern - Game Character States](header.png)

In object oriented programming State Pattern is one of the way to implement *Finite State Machines*. This pattern falls under *Behavioral Design Patterns*.

When in our software, object can transit between multiple possible states, and changes it's behaviour accoring to state, Then this type of problems can be easily solved using *[Finite State Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)*, and this pattern helps us to achive  this.
